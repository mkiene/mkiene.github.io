## Fundamentals

Let's discuss the fundamental components of algebra, which are **variables**, **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, **division**, **exponents**, and **radicals**. While these terms are likely familiar, I think it's valuable to reiterate their definitions.

### Variables

> A **variable** is simply an alias, or placeholder, for a numerical quantity which may vary. Common variables are $x, y, a, b, c$, but variables can be whatever you want them to be.

For example, you could say "I bought $x$ apples from the store," where $x$ could be any number you choose, depending on the number of apples you bought.

### Addition

> Algebraic addition simply extends arithmetic addition by the inclusion of variables like $a, b, x, y,$ etc.
{: .prompt-info }

For example, $a+5$ would represent the value of $a$, plus $5$.

### Subtraction

> Algebraic subtraction similarly extends arithmetic subtraction by the inclusion of variables like $a, b, x, y,$ etc.
{: .prompt-info }

For example, $a-5$ would represent the value of $a$, minus $5$.

### Multiplication

> Multiplication is just repeated addition.
{: .prompt-info }

For example,

$$
5 \cdot a = a + a + a + a + a
$$

$5 \cdot a$ is akin to saying "I have five of $a$."

### Division

> Division is grouping.
{: .prompt-info }

$$
\frac{a}{5} = b
$$

This is like saying "I'm splitting up $a$ into five groups, and $b$ is the size of each group."

So for example, if I want to split up $20$ into five groups, I can ask "what number is five times smaller than $20$?" Or, "What times five equals $20$?" Of course, the answer is four:

$$
\begin{align*}
5 + 5 + 5 + 5 &= 20 \\
4 \cdot 5 &= 20 \\
\frac{20}{5} &= 4 \\
\end{align*}
$$

### Exponents

> Exponentiation is just repeated multiplication, much like how multiplication is repeated addition.
{: .prompt-info }

For example, $x^{5}$ is like saying "I'm multiplying $x$ by itself, five times."

$$
x^{5} = x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x
$$

### Radicals

> Radicals, or roots, are the inverse of exponents.
{: .prompt-info }

An expression like $\sqrt[2]{x}$ is the same as asking "what number to the power of $2$ is equal to $x$?" Think about the weird squiggly line thing as that question.

So, how would we think about $\sqrt[2]{9}$?

We can ask: "What number, times itself, equals $9$?" So, the answer is $3 \cdot 3 = 9$. Also expressed as $3^2 = 9$.

## Expressions & Equations

An algebraic expression is a relationship between a variable and some constants. For example, $2x+3$ is an expression in terms of $x$. 

An algebraic equation is when you set an expression equal to something. So, $2x+3 = 6$ is an equation.

$$
\begin{align*}
a \cdot 1 &= a \\
a \cdot \frac{2}{2} &= \frac{2a}{2}
\end{align*}
$$

## Summary

> **Key Takeaways**
> - The building blocks of algebra are **variables**, **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, **division**, **exponents**, and **radicals**.
> - Multiplication is repeated addition, and exponents are repeated multiplication.
> - Division is grouping or splitting, and radicals are the inverse of exponents.
> - An **expression** combines variables and constants (e.g. $2x+3$).
> - An **equation** sets an expression equal to something else (e.g. $2x+3=6$).
