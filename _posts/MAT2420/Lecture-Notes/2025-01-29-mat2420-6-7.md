## One–Dimensional Variable Density 

Imagine an "infinitely thin" metal bar of variable density laid on the $x$–axis. Assume the length of this bar is $b-a$.

![](/assets/images/MAT2420/6.7/6-7-1-dark.svg){: .dark }


If the density function for the bar is $\rho \left( x \right)$, what is the mass of the bar? We know that $\text{mass}=\text{density} \times \text{volume}$, and since our bar is "infinitely thin," i.e. one–dimensional, its mass is $\text{density} \times \text{length}$.

- The mass of the $k^{\text{th}}$ subinterval is approximately equal to $\rho \left( x \right) \Delta x$.
- The mass of the entire bar (from $a$ to $b$) is approximately equal to 

    $$
    \sum_{k=1}^{m} \rho \left( x \right) \mathrm{d}x
    ,$$

    which, as $m \to \infty$ (or $\Delta x \to 0$), becomes

    $$
    \int_{a}^{b} \rho \left( x \right) \mathrm{d}x
    .$$

This is the mass of the thin metal bar with variable density $\rho \left( x \right).$

## Force & Work 

Work is simply the energy transferred to or from an object via the application of force along a displacement.

> Force 
>
> Force is represented with the units $N,$ or Newtons. One newton is the force required to give a $\pu{1kg}$ mass an acceleration of $\pu{1 m/s2}.$
{: .prompt-info }

If a constant force  is aligned with the direction of motion, then

$$
\text{work} = \text{force} \times \text{distance}
.$$

> Work
> Work is measured in Joules, where one Joule is the work does when a force of $\pu{1N}$ displaces a mass 1 meter.

## One–Dimensional Variable Force 

Force can be uniform or variable. If force is variable, denote it by $F \left( x \right)$.
Suppose you have an object laying on the $x$–axis. How much work is done in moving that object from $a$ to $b$ if we have a variable force (aligned with the $x$–axis) $F \left( x \right)$?

![](/assets/images/MAT2420/6.7/6-7-2-dark.svg){: .dark }


It turns out that the amount of work done is given by

$$
\text{work} = \int_{a}^{b} F \left( x \right) \mathrm{d}x
.$$

## Hooke's Law for Springs

The force required to keep a spring either stretched or compressed at a position $x$ units from equilibrium is proportional to the "stiffness of the spring.

Furthermore, $x$ is directly proportional to $y$, where $k$ is the constant of proportionality; in this context, $k$ can also be thought of as the "stiffness" of the spring.

## Example for the Application of Hooke's Law

Suppose a force of $\pu{10N}$ is required to stretch a spring $\pu{0.1m}$ from its equilibrium (holding it in position).

1. How much work (joules) is required to compress the spring $\pu{0.5m}$ from its equilibrium?

    First, we need to find the stiffness constant $k$ of the spring.

    $$
    \begin{align*}
    F &= kx \\
    10 &= k \left( 0.1 \right) \\
    k &= 100
    .\end{align*}
    $$

    Therefore,

    $$
    F \left( x \right) = 100x
    .$$

    Since we are *compressing* the spring $\pu{0.5 m}$, we can integrate over $\left[ -0.5, 0 \right].$

    $$
    \begin{align*}
    \text{work} &= \int_{a}^{b} F \left( x \right) \,\mathrm{d}x = \int_{-0.5}^{0} 100x \,\mathrm{d}x \\
    &= 100 \int_{-0.5}^{0} x \,\mathrm{d}x \\
    &= 100 \left[ \frac{1}{2} x^{2} \right]_{-0.5}^{0} \\
    &= 100 \left[ 0 - \left( \frac{\left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) ^{2}}{2} \right)  \right]  \\
    &= \boxed{\pu{12.5 J}}
    .\end{align*}
    $$

1. How much additional work is required to stretch the spring $\pu{0.2 m}$, if it has already been stretched $\pu{0.1 m}$ from equilibrium?

    We can simply integrate over $[0.1,0.3]$ using the same constant we found earlier.

    $$
    \int_{0.1}^{0.3} F \left( x \right) \,\mathrm{d}x = \int_{0.1}^{0.3} 100x \,\mathrm{d}x = \boxed{ \pu{4 J} }
    .$$

## Work Required for Lifting

The force due to gravity at the surface of the earth acting upon an object of mass $m$ ($\pu{kg}$) is given by

$$
F = mg,
$$

where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the earth.

The work needed to lift an object of mass $m$ a vertical distance of $y$ meters is given by

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{work} &= \text{force} \times \text{distance} \\
&= mg \cdot y \, \left( \text{joules} \right)
.\end{align*}
$$

## Lifting Problem (one–dimensional)

A chain of length $L$ with constant density $\pu{\rho \, kg/m}$ hangs vertically. What is the work needed to lift the entire chain?

First, we can partition $\left[ 0, L \right]$ into $n$ equal–length subintervals.

![](/assets/images/MAT2420/6.7/6-7-4-light.svg){: .light }
![](/assets/images/MAT2420/6.7/6-7-4-dark.svg){: .dark }


The mass of the chain on the $k^{\text{th}}$ subinterval is given by

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{mass} &= \text{density} \times \text{distance} \\
m &= \rho \Delta y
.\end{align*}
$$

The point $y_{k}^{\*}$ needs to be lifted a distance of $L-y_{k}^{\*}$. Therefore, the work needed to lift the $k^{\text{th}}$ subinterval is

$$
\begin{align*}
W_{k} &= \text{force} \times \text{distance} \\
&= \left( \text{mass} \times \text{acceleration} \right) \left( L-y_{k}^{*} \right) \\
&= \rho \Delta y g \left( L - y_{k}^{*} \right)  \\
&= \rho g \left( L - y_{k}^{*} \right) \Delta y
.\end{align*}
$$

So, to lift the entire chain, the work required is given by

$$
W = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \rho g \left( L-y_{k}^{*} \right) \Delta y
.$$

As $n \to \infty$, or as $\Delta y \to 0$,

$$
\sum_{k=1}^{n} \rho g \left( L - y_{k}^{*} \right) \Delta y \longrightarrow \int_{0}^{L} \rho g \left( L - y \right) \,\mathrm{d}y
.$$

> Work to Lift Chain
>
> The total work required to lift a chain of length $L$ and density $\rho$, assuming the bottom of the chain is at the origin, is given by
> $$
> \int_{0}^{L} \rho g \left( L - y \right) \,\mathrm{d}y
> .$$

## Example Problem

Find the work reeded to lift/pump water out of a tank.

1. The density of water is $\rho = \pu{1 g/cm3} = \pu{1000 kg/m3}$.
2. The mass of water is $\text{density} \times \text{volume}$.

![](/assets/images/MAT2420/6.7/6-7-5-light.svg){: .light }
![](/assets/images/MAT2420/6.7/6-7-5-dark.svg){: .dark }


We can partition $\left[ 0,b \right]$ into $n$ equal–length subintervals.

![[Figure 6]]

The volume of water in the $k^{\text{th}}$ subinterval is given by

$$
V = A \left( y_{k}^{*} \right) \Delta y
.$$

The mass of water in the $k^{\text{th}}$ subinterval is given by

$$
\begin{align*}
M &= \text{density} \times \text{volume} \\
&= \rho A \left( y_{k}^{*} \right) \Delta y
.\end{align*}
$$

The force required to lift the $k^{\text{th}}$ subinterval is given by

$$
\begin{align*}
F &= mg \\
&= \rho A \left( y_{k}^{*} \right) \Delta y g
.\end{align*}
$$

The work required to lift the $k^{\text{th}}$ subinterval to height $h$ is given by

$$
\begin{align*}
W &= \text{force} \times \text{distance} \\
&= \rho A \left( y_{k}^{*} \right) g \Delta y \left( h - y_{k}^{*} \right) \\
&= \rho A \left( y_{k}^{*} \right) g \left( h-y_{k}^{*} \right) \delta y
.\end{align*}
$$
