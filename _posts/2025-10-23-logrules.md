## Logarithm Rules List

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Conversion:} &\quad b^{x} = y \longleftrightarrow \log_b(y) = x \\
\text{Change of Base:} &\quad \log_b(a) = \frac{\log_c(a)}{\log_c(b)} = \frac{\log a}{\log b} = \frac{\ln a}{\ln b} \\
\text{Product:} &\quad \log (a \cdot b) = \log (a) + \log (b) \\
\text{Quotient:} &\quad \log \left( \frac{a}{b} \right) = \log (a) - \log (b) \\
\text{Power:} &\quad \log \left( a^{c} \right) = c \cdot \log (a)
\end{align*}
$$

## Discussion

#### Introduction

A logarithm's goal is to find the value of the exponent without guessing and checking. It "undoes" exponentiation, much like how division undoes multiplication, and how subtraction undoes addition:

$$
\begin{align*}
    10+5-5 &= 10 \\
\frac{10 \cdot 5}{5} &= 10 \\
5^{\log_5(10)} &= 10
.\end{align*}
$$

The parentheses around that 5 does not mean multiplication, rather, it means you're passing $5$ to the logarithm function, and getting a result back. The expression inside the input parentheses is called the **argument** of the logarithm.

> note: $\log_5$ by itself is not a single value, just as a curve defined by $f(x)$ is not a single value. You need to input a single number to retrieve a single output.

#### Converting between Exponential and Logarithmic forms

The relationship between an exponential equation, like $y=2^{x}$, and a logarithm is as follows:

$$
4=2^{x} \longleftrightarrow \log_2\left(4\right) = x
$$

Remember that the whole goal of a logarithm is to find what exponent is needed in order for the equation to be true. You can think of a logarithm as asking, "what power does the base need to be raised to in order to equal the result?"

In the specific case of $y=2^{x}$, the logarithm asks "what power does 2 need to be raised to in order to equal four?"

#### Common & Natural Logarithms

The common logarithm is defined as $\log_{10}(x)$, and is often written as just $\log(x)$. If you see a logarithm without a base, like $\log(x)$, you can always assume that the base is 10.

The natural logarithm is defined as $\log_e(x)$, and is often written as $\ln(x)$. These expressions are equivalent, but the standard is to write $\ln(x)$ instead of $\log_e(x)$

### Change of Base Formula

Often, it's somewhat difficult to compute a logarithm with a base that is not 10 or $e$. So, we can use a tool called the change of base:

$$
\log_b(a) = \frac{\log_c(a)}{\log_c(b)} = \frac{\log a}{\log b} = \frac{\ln a}{\ln b}
$$

This means you can turn a logarithm into a quotient of logarithms with any base you want (often, choosing the right base will make the problem simpler). For example, if I wanted to compute $\log_2(e)$, I could rewrite it as

$$
\log_2(e) = \frac{\log_e(e)}{\log_e(2)} = \frac{\ln e}{\ln 2} = \frac{1}{\ln 2}
$$

This is now easy to enter into a calculator.

#### Product, Quotient, and Power Rules

The product rule says that a logarithm with a product in the argument can be split into a sum of logarithms with the same base:

$$
\log (a \cdot b) = \log (a) + \log (b)
$$

The quotient rule is similar to the product rule, except it says that a division in the argument can be split into a difference of logarithms with the same base:

$$
\log \left( \frac{a}{b} \right) = \log (a) - \log (b)
$$

Finally, the power rule says that an exponent in the argument can be moved to the front of the logarithm as a coefficient:

$$
\log \left( a^{c} \right) = c \cdot \log (a)
$$
