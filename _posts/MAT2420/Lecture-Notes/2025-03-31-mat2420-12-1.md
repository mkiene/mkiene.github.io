## Parametric Equations

###### _"ordered pair valued functions"_

$t$ is the independent variable/parameter. It usually represents time.

$$
\begin{align*}
\left(x \left(t\right), y \left(t\right)\right) \quad a \leq t \leq b
.\end{align*}
$$

Consider the parametric equation for straight line passing through point $\left(x_{0}, y_{0}\right)$ and with slope $m=\frac{b}{a}$. To find this parametric equations, we first need to find the independent variable (which is usually written as $t$). So we can simply relabel $x$ as $t$.

$$
\begin{align*}
x &= x(t) = t \\
y &= y(t) = m \left(t-x_{0}\right)+y_{0}
.\end{align*}
$$

The parametric representation would be

$$
\begin{align*}
\left(t, m \left(t-x_{0}\right)+y_{0}\right)
.\end{align*}
$$

Alternatively,

$$
\begin{align*}
\left(x_{0}+at, y_{0}+bt\right)
.\end{align*}
$$

So it is evidently very easy to parametrize rectangular equations. It is important to note that parametric representations of a rectangular equation are not unique.

### ex. Change $y=3x-2$ to parametric form.

The easiest way to change is to let

$$
\begin{align*}
x &= x(t) = t \\
y &= y(t) = 3t-2
.\end{align*}
$$

So the parametric form is

$$
\begin{align*}
\left(t, 3t-2\right)
.\end{align*}
$$

Alternatively, the rectangular equation can be expressed as the following. Let

$$
\begin{align*}
m &= 3 = \frac{3}{1} \\
\left(x_{0}, y_{0}\right) &= \underbrace{\left(0, -2\right)}_{\text{for example}} \\
x(t) &= 0+1t \\
y(t) &= -2+3t
.\end{align*}
$$
