## Introduction 

Hello college algebra students! I'm Max Kiene, your SLA (Student Learning Assistant).

Over the course of the semester, we will be covering a lot of topics. Thus, Gustavo and I have decided that it will benefit the class to maintain weekly summaries of the content covered. This website is where you will find those summaries.

Before those start, I think it's important to cover the layout of these notes.

## Recap Layout

### Summary
Our class notes will start with a short summary of what the week's topic(s) were, usually no more than a couple sentences. This will be right underneath the title of the post, above my name and post date.

### Callouts

> This is a callout.
{: .prompt-tip }

> These will usually contain tips for problem--solving, defining terms, important notes, etc.
{: .prompt-warning }

> They will be differently colored depending on the type of info they contain.
{: .prompt-danger }

### Equations

Math is neatly typeset using MathJax:

$$
\begin{align*}
a^2+b^2&=c^2 \label{eq:pythagoras} \tag{1} \\
c&=\pm\sqrt{a^2+b^2}
\end{align*}
$$

Equations may be referenced by number, like \eqref{eq:pythagoras}, which shows the Pythagorean theorem.

### Diagrams
In addition to equations, I will occasionally provide diagrams/figures for visual reference:

<!-- ![](/assets/images/gustavo/light.svg){: style="filter: invert(70%);" .dark } -->
![](/assets/img/gustavo/light.svg){: .tikz }

<!-- <details class="solution-toggle"> -->
<!-- <summary></summary> -->
<!-- <div> -->
<!--         <p> -->
<!--             This is the solution. -->
<!--         </p> -->
<!-- </div> -->
<!-- </details> -->

## Conclusion

The most important takeaway from this post is that you will be provided with consistent and centralized access to course notes, something which we believe will greatly improve your experience as a student. If you have any comments, questions, or concerns, feel free to reach out to Gustavo and/or myself.

Looking forward to a great semester!
