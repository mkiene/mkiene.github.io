## Taylor Polynomial

$$
\int e^{-x^{2}} \,\mathrm{d}x = \; ?
$$

It turns out that one cannot use Riemann integrals for this function. Instead, we can use a Lebesgue integral or a power series.

### Power Series of a Continuous and $n$<sup>th</sup> Differentiable Function $f(x)$ Centered at $x=a$ ($a$ is any constant).

We will approximate $f(x)$ by a $n^{\text{th}}$ degree polynomial near $x=a$. $P_{n} \left(x\right) \to n^{\text{th}}$ degree polynomial approximation of $f(x)$.

$$
P_{n} \left(x\right) = C_{0} + C_{1} x + C_{2} x^{2} + \dots + C_{n} x^{n}
$$

where $C_{0},\dots,C_{n}$ are constants. Recall $P_{1} \left(x\right)$ from Calc 1, the tangent line of $f(x)$ at $x=a$. Then, the slope of $P_{1} \left(x\right)$ is $f'(a)$. Using pointâ€“slope form,

$$
\begin{align*}
y-y_{0} &= m \left(x-x_{0}\right) \\
y-f(a) &= f'(a) \left(x-a\right) \\
P_{1} (x) = y &= f(a) + f'(a) \left(x-a\right)
.\end{align*}
$$

Suppose that near $x=a, \; f(x)$ has a lot of "curvature," so then $P_{1} (x)$ might not be the best approximation. We can instead approximate $f(x)$ with a $2^{\text{nd}}$ degree polynomial $P_{2} (x)$. In other words, add a quadratic term (increasing the degree of approximation from linear to quadratic):

$$
\begin{align*}
P_{2} (x) &= P_{1} (x) + \text{quadratic term} \\
&= f(a) + f'(a) \left(x-a\right) + C_{2} \left(x-a\right)^{2}
.\end{align*}
$$

where

1. $P_{2}(a) = f(a)$
2. $P_{2}'(a)=f'(a)$
3. $P_{2}''(a)=f''(a)$

These conditions must be met in order for $P_{2}(x)$ to be a good approximation for $f(x)$ near $x=a$. Let's check the conditions for the previous polynomial:

Condition 1:

$$
\begin{align*}
P_{2} (x) &= f(a) + f'(a) \left(x-a\right) + C_{2} \left(x-a\right)^{2} \\
P_{2} \left(a\right) &= f(a)
.\end{align*}
$$

---

Condition 2:

$$
\begin{align*}
P_{2}'(x) &= f'(a)+2C_{2} \left(x-a\right) \\
P_{2}' (a) &= f'(a)
.\end{align*}
$$

---

Condition 3:

$$
\begin{align*}
P_{2}''(x) &= 2C_{2} \\
C_{2} &= \frac{f''(a)}{2}
.\end{align*}
$$

---

Therefore,

$$
P_{2}(x) = f(a) + f'(a) (x-a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2} \left(x-a\right)^{2}.
$$

The pattern is the following:

$$
\begin{align*}
P_{1}(x) &= f(a) + f'(a) \left(x-a\right) \\
P_{2} (x) &= f(a) + f'(a) \left(x-a\right) + \frac{f''(a)}{2} \left(x-a\right)^{2} \\
P_{3}(x) &= f(a)+f'(a) \left(x-a\right) + \frac{f''(a)}{2} \left(x-a\right)^{2} + \frac{f'''(a)}{6} \left(x-a\right)^{3} \\
P_{4} \left(x\right) &= P_{3}(x) + \frac{f^{(4)}(a)}{24} \left(x-a\right)^{4} \\
&\text{and so on}
.\end{align*}
$$

### Remainder of Taylor Polynomial

Given a function $f(x)$ (continuous with $n$ derivatives), let $P_{n}(x)$ be the Taylor polynomial of $f(x)$ centered at $x=a$.

The $n^{\text{th}}$ remainder term is

$$
R_{n}(x)=f(x)-P_{n}(x)
$$

Recall the Mean Value Theorem: given a continuous and differentiable function over an interval $\left[a,b\right]$, there is a point $c$ on $f(x)$ over that interval such that the slope of $c$ is equivalent to the slope of the secant line passing through $(a,f(a)),(b,f(b))$.

As a consequence of this theorem, we have

$$
R_{n}(x) = \frac{f^{(n+1)}(c)}{(n+1)!} \left(x-a\right)^{n+1} \quad \text{where} \; c \; \text{is very close to} \; a.
$$

For the scope of this class, $c$ remains enigmatic.
