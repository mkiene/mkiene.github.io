## Inequalities

What does it mean for an expression to have an inequality? Take for example the inequality

$$
y \le x
$$

If I express this in words, I am saying that any value of $y$ in my solution has to be less or equal to my input $x$. So if I plug in $5$, I know that $y$ must be at most $5$, or less.

#### Compound Inequalities

A compound inequality is created when two inequalities are joined together.

For example, I can join the following inequalities together:

$$
\begin{align*}
{\color{red} -3 \le}\; 2x+&5, \quad 2x+5 \;{\color{orange} \le 7} \\
{\color{red} -3 \le}\; &2x+5 \;{\color{orange} \le 7}
\end{align*}
$$

Perhaps a simpler example would be

$$
0 \le x \le 10
$$

What is this inequality saying? Well, if we split this into two inequalities, it might be easier to see:

$$
\begin{align*}
x &\ge 0 \\
x &\le 10
\end{align*}
$$

The first inequality is saying that the values that $x$ can have are greater than or equal to zero, and the second inequality is saying that the values that $x$ can have are less than or equal to $10$.

Combining these English statements, we have "$x$ is greater than or equal to zero, and also less than or equal to $10$." This is just representing all of the numbers between $0$ and $10$!

So, $0 \le x \le 10$ is the same as the interval $[0, 10]$.

## Absolute Value

Absolute value is a way of measuring the *distance* of a number from zero, regardless of its direction on the number line. In other words:

- $\|5\| = 5$ (since $5$ is $5$ units away from zero),
- $\|-5\| = 5$ (since $-5$ is also $5$ units away from zero).

So absolute value strips away the sign and leaves only the magnitude.

A useful analogy is thinking about how far a person is from their home: whether you walk 5 blocks east or 5 blocks west, you’re still 5 blocks away. Absolute value captures that idea.

#### Example Problem

Let's solve the following absolute value equation:

$$
\begin{align*}
-5 \left| 1-3x \right| + 4 &= -31 \\
-5 \left| 1-3x \right| &= -35 \\
\left| 1-3x \right| &= 7
.\end{align*}
$$

At this point, we need to remember that absolute value can give two cases: the expression inside could be equal to $7$ or equal to $-7$.

So, we split it up:

$$
\begin{align*}
1 - 3x &= 7 \quad \text{or} \quad 1 - 3x = -7
\end{align*}
$$

Solving each:

$$
\begin{align*}
1 - 3x &= 7 &\quad\Rightarrow\quad -3x = 6 &\quad\Rightarrow\quad x = -2 \\
1 - 3x &= -7 &\quad\Rightarrow\quad -3x = -8 &\quad\Rightarrow\quad x = \tfrac{8}{3}
\end{align*}
$$

So the solution set is:

$$
x = -2 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \tfrac{8}{3}
$$

In interval notation, these are just two discrete points: $\{-2, \tfrac{8}{3}\}$.

More generally, if you see an inequality like $\|x\| \le a$, this translates into a compound inequality:

$$
-a \le x \le a
$$

And if you see $\|x\| \ge a$, this translates into:

$$
x \le -a \quad \text{or} \quad x \ge a
$$

This is one of the most important uses of absolute value: it naturally expresses a range of distances on the number line.

## Transformations

Transformations are ways of changing or shifting the graph of a function without changing its basic shape. The main types are:

1. **Vertical shifts**
   - Adding a constant: $f(x) + c$ shifts the graph up by $c$.
   - Subtracting a constant: $f(x) - c$ shifts the graph down by $c$.

2. **Horizontal shifts**
   - Replacing $x$ with $(x-c)$: $f(x-c)$ shifts the graph right by $c$.
   - Replacing $x$ with $(x+c)$: $f(x+c)$ shifts the graph left by $c$. 

3. **Reflections**
   - $-f(x)$ reflects the graph across the $x$–axis.
   - $f(-x)$ reflects the graph across the $y$–axis.

4. **Stretching and compressing**
   - $a \cdot f(x)$ with $\|a\| > 1$ makes the graph taller (vertical stretch).
   - $a \cdot f(x)$ with $0 < \|a\| < 1$ makes the graph shorter (vertical compression).
   - $f(ax)$ with $\|a\| > 1$ compresses the graph horizontally.
   - $f(ax)$ with $0 < \|a\| < 1$ stretches the graph horizontally.

These rules let us take a “parent” function, like $f(x) = \|x\|$ or $f(x) = x^2$, and predict exactly how its graph will move, flip, or stretch.

## Very short tutorial for using Desmos

- Entering equations: Just type something like y = x^2 or f(x) = \|x-3\| into the left panel. Desmos will automatically graph it.
- Inequalities: Use $<$, $>$, $\le$, $\ge$. For example, typing $y \le x$ shades the region below the line $y = x$.

Piecewise functions: Use curly braces. For example:

$$
f(x) = \{x < 2: x, \; x \ge 2: x-1\}
$$

- Absolute value: Use vertical bars $\|\|$. For example: $y = \|x-4\|$.
- Zooming/Navigation: Use your mouse/trackpad to drag the graph or scroll to zoom in and out.

That’s enough to handle inequalities, absolute value, and piecewise functions for this lecture.

## Summary

> **Summary**: This lecture covered inequalities, absolute value, and transformations.  
> 1. **Inequalities**: Express relationships like $y \le x$; compound inequalities (e.g., $0 \le x \le 10$) represent ranges of values and can be written in interval notation.  
> 2. **Absolute value**: Measures distance from zero, always nonnegative. Solving $\|\|$ equations or inequalities often splits into two cases.  
>    - $\|x\| \le a \;\;\Rightarrow\;\; -a \le x \le a$  
>    - $\|x\| \ge a \;\;\Rightarrow\;\; x \le -a$ or $x \ge a$  
> 3. **Transformations**: Shift, reflect, stretch, or compress graphs by modifying $f(x)$.  
>    - $f(x)+c$ moves up, $f(x-c)$ moves right, $-f(x)$ flips over the $x$–axis, etc.  
>
> In short: inequalities define ranges, absolute value captures distance, and transformations help predict how parent graphs move or stretch.
