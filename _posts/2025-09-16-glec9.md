## Complex Numbers

A **complex number** is a number of the form

$$
a + bi
$$

where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $i$ is the **imaginary unit**, defined by

$$
i^2 = -1.
$$

In other words,

$$
\sqrt{-1} = i
$$

- The real part is $a$.
- The imaginary part is $b$.

### Examples

- $3 + 2i$ (real part $3$, imaginary part $2$)
- $-5i$ (real part $0$, imaginary part $-5$)
- $7$ (real part $7$, imaginary part $0$ â€” a purely real number)

## Adding and Subtracting Complex Numbers

You combine like terms: real parts with real parts, imaginary parts with imaginary parts.

#### Example

$$
(3 + 4i) + (5 - 2i) = (3+5) + (4i - 2i) = 8 + 2i
$$

$$
(6 - i) - (2 + 3i) = (6-2) + (-1 - 3)i = 4 - 4i
$$

---

## Multiplying Complex Numbers

You multiply as if they are polynomials and then simplify using $i^2 = -1$.

#### Example

$$
(2 + 3i)(4 - i) = 8 - 2i + 12i - 3i^2
$$

Since $i^2 = -1$, this becomes:

$$
8 + 10i - 3(-1) = 8 + 10i + 3 = 11 + 10i
$$

## Perfect Squares

Recall that a **perfect square** takes the form

$$
(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
$$

and

$$
(a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2.
$$

---

## Perfect Squares with Complex Numbers

The same rules apply when $b$ involves $i$.

#### Example

$$
(2x+3i)^2 = (2x)^2 + 2(2x)(3i) + (3i)^2
$$

$$
= 4x^2 + 12xi + 9i^2
$$

Since $i^2 = -1$:

$$
= 4x^2 + 12xi - 9
$$

So the expanded form is:

$$
(2x+3i)^2 = 4x^2 + 12xi - 9
$$

## Inverse Functions

An **inverse function** reverses the effect of the original function. If $f$ takes $x$ to $y$, then $f^{-1}$ takes $y$ back to $x$. Symbolically:

$$
f(f^{-1}(x)) = x \quad \text{and} \quad f^{-1}(f(x)) = x
$$

### Method for Finding Inverses

1. Start with $y = f(x)$.
2. Solve the equation for $x$ in terms of $y$.
3. Swap the roles of $x$ and $y$.

That gives $f^{-1}(x)$.

#### Example

$$
f(x) = 3x+5
$$

1. Write $y = 3x + 5$
2. Solve for $x$: $x = \tfrac{y-5}{3}$
3. Swap $x$ and $y$:

$$
f^{-1}(x) = \tfrac{x-5}{3}
$$

## Graphical Interpretation

- The graph of $f^{-1}(x)$ is the reflection of $f(x)$ across the line $y=x$ (the identity function).
- This reflection shows the symmetry between an input-output pair and its reversal.
