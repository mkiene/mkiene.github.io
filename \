## Inequalities

- what it means to have an inequality like $y \le x$

What does it mean for an expression to have an inequality? Take for example the inequality

$$
y \le x
$$

If I express this in words, I am saying that any value of $y$ has to be less or equal to my input $x$

- desmos graph of $y \le x+1$

#### Compound Inequalities

A compound inequality is created when two inequalities are joined together.

For example, I can join the following inequalities together:

$$
\begin{align*}
{\color{red} -3 \le}\; 2x+&5, \quad 2x+5 \;{\color{orange} \le 7} \\
{\color{red} -3 \le}\; &2x+5 \;{\color{orange} \le 7}
\end{align*}
$$

Perhaps a simpler example would be

$$
0 \le x \le 10
$$

What is this inequality saying? Well, if we split this into two inequalities, it might be easier to see:

$$
\begin{align*}
x &\ge 0 \\
x &\le 10
\end{align*}
$$

The first inequality is saying that the values that $x$ can have are greater than or equal to zero, and the second inequality is saying that the values that $x$ can have are less than or equal to $10$.

Combining these English statements, we have "$x$ is greater than or equal to zero, and also less than or equal to $10$." This is just representing all of the numbers between $0$ and $10$!

So, $0 \le x \le 10$ is the same as the interval $[0, 10]$.

## Absolute Value

- what absolute value means
- maybe analogy?

#### Example Problem

$$
\begin{align*}
-5 \left| 1-3x \right| + 4 &= -31 \\
-5 \left| 1-3x \right| &= -35 \\
\left| 1-3x \right| &= 7
.\end{align*}
$$
