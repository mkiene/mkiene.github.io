## Sets

> A set is simply a collection of elements, usually denotated by $\\{$brackets$\\}$. In our case, the elements will be numbers.
{: .prompt-info }

For example, the set of the whole numbers between $1$ and $10$ would look like

$$
\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 \}
$$

A shorthand way to write sets of numbers is by using dots instead of writing out all of the numbers:

$$
\{ 1, 2, \cdots, 9, 10 \}
$$

> Often, it's necessary to use this notation. For example, it's impossible to write out all of the positive integers (natural numbers):

> \mathbb{N} = \{ 1, 2, 3, \cdots, \infty \}

## Relation vs Function

> A relation is a way in which two sets are related.
{: .prompt-info }

For example, we can relate the sets $\\{ 1, 2, 3 \\} $ and $\\{ 4, 5, 6 \\}$:

![](/assets/img/gustavo/figures/gw1/relation.svg){: .tikz }

We can see that $1$ connects to $4$ and $5$, $2$ connects to $6$, and $3$ connects to $5$.

> A function is a special type of relation, where each element of the input set maps to a unique element of the output set.
{: .prompt-info }

Note that it is perfectly fine for multiple inputs to have the same output, but it isn't okay for multiple outputs to have the same input.

![](/assets/img/gustavo/figures/gw1/function.svg){: .tikz }

Graphically, it's good to use the vertical line test, which more clearly shows if there are multiple outputs ($y$--values) per input ($x$--value).

{% include desmos.html hash="dmr6qot8yk" %}

The above function, $\sin(x)$, passes the vertical line test, since there is only one intersection between the vertical line. An example of a graph which doesn't obey the vertical line test (and is therefore not a function) is a circle:

<!-- <iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/hkn6y1s9gb?embed"></iframe> -->

{% include desmos.html hash="hkn6y1s9gb" %}



As you can see, there are two outputs for $f(x)$ for every $x$ on the interval $(-1, 1)$.

## Interval Notation

Let's look at the graph of the function $f(x)=x$:

{% include desmos.html hash="7nrq3pr9ll" %}

If we wanted to only consider the points on the line from $x=0$ to $x=1$, we would write that interval as

$$
[0, 1]
$$

Here, we use the $[$square brackets$]$ because we want to include $0$ and $1$ in that interval.

If we don't want to include $0$ or $1$ in the interval, we'd use $($parenthesis$)$ instead:

$$
(0,1)
$$

In simple terms, a bracket means include, and a parenthesis means don't include.

## Domain and Range

> The domain of a function is the set of all possible inputs for that function.
{: .prompt-info }

For example, consider the function $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$.

{% include desmos.html hash="imrknxkmh0" %}

If our input ($x$) is less than zero, we would be trying to take the root of a negative number, which has no real answer. Since we can take the root of zero and any positive number, the domain of this function would be

$$
[0, \infty)
$$

In other words, the values of $x$ when it's less than $0$ are the values which cause trouble for us.

## Summary

> **Key Takeaways**
>
> - A **set** is a collection of elements, often numbers, written with braces.
> - A **relation** connects elements of two sets; a **function** is a relation where each input has exactly one output.
> - Use the **vertical line test** to check if a graph is a function.
> - **Interval notation** uses brackets $[\,]$ for inclusion and parentheses $(\,)$ for exclusion.
> - The **domain** is the set of valid inputs, and the **range** is the set of resulting outputs.
